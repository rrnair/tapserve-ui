  - Offline demo component for testing

=== Updated Expense Form (src/app/expenses/add/page.tsx)

  - Works completely offline
  - Dynamic UI feedback based on connection status
  - Automatic sync when online
  - Clear user messaging for offline operations

=== ðŸš€ How It Works

  . Offline Entry: Users can create expenses even without internet - data is stored locally in
  IndexedDB
  . Automatic Sync: When connection returns, expenses automatically sync to the server
  . Real-time Status: UI shows current sync status with pending counts
  . Error Handling: Failed syncs are retried with exponential backoff
  . Conflict Resolution: Handles conflicts between local and server data

  ðŸ’¡ Usage Example
[source,javascript]
----
  // Add an expense (works offline or online)
  const newExpense = await addExpense({
    amount: 1500,
    description: "Office supplies",
    vendorName: "Staples",
    // ... other fields
  })

  // Check sync status
  const { isOnline, pendingCount, isSyncing } = useNetworkStatus()

  // Manual sync trigger
  await syncNow()
----

The system provides a seamless offline experience where users never lose data and everything syncs automatically when connectivity is restored. The visual indicators keep users informed of the current sync status at all times.
